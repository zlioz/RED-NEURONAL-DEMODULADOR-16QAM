# RED-NEURONAL-DEMODULADOR-16QAM

This notebook has two parts, both are a multilayer neural network design.
The first part consists of an assisted learning method using the sklearn and keras libraries, and the second part uses an unsupervised learning method with the Kmeans classification algorithm.

Both algorithms fulfill the role of optimizing the decision where the symbol belongs and improve the BER performance.
